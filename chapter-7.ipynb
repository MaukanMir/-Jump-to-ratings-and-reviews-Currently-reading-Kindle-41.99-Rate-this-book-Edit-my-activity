    "### Responsible for retrieving relevant documents for a given query. Retrievers are usually categorized as sparse or dense. Sparse retrievers use word frequencies to represent each document and query as a sparse vector.11 The relevance of a query and a document is then determined by computing an inner product of the vectors. On the other hand, dense retrievers use encoders like transformers to represent the query and document as contextualized embeddings (which are dense vectors). These embeddings encode semantic meaning, and allow dense retrievers to improve search accuracy by understanding the content of the query.\n",
