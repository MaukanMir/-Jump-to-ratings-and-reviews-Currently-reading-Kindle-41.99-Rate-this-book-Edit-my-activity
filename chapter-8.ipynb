    "## Making Models Smaller via Knowledge Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge distillation is a general-purpose method for training a smaller student model to mimic the behavior of a slower, larger, but better-performing teacher. Originally introduced in 2006 in the context of ensemble models,3 it was later popularized in a famous 2015 paper that generalized the method to deep neural networks and applied it to image classification and automatic speech recognition.4\n",
    "\n",
    "### With the KL divergence we can calculate how much is lost when we approximate the probability distribution of the teacher with the student. This allows us to define a knowledge distillation loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A good rule of thumb from the literature is that knowledge distillation works best when the teacher and student are of the same model type.9 One possible reason for this is that different model types, say BERT and RoBERTa, can have different output embedding spaces, which hinders the ability of the student to mimic the teacher. In our case study the teacher is BERT, so DistilBERT is a natural candidate to initialize the student with since it has 40% fewer parameters and has been shown to achieve strong results on downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Models Faster with Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "### We’ve now seen that with knowledge distillation we can reduce the computational and memory cost of running inference by transferring the information from a teacher into a smaller student. Quantization takes a different approach; instead of reducing the number of computations, it makes them much more efficient by representing the weights and activations with low-precision data types like 8-bit integer (INT8) instead of the usual 32-bit floating point (FP32). Reducing the number of bits means the resulting model requires less memory storage, and operations like matrix multiplication can be performed much faster with integer arithmetic. Remarkably, these performance gains can be realized with little to no loss in accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now, one of the main reasons why transformers (and deep neural networks more generally) are prime candidates for quantization is that the weights and activations tend to take values in relatively small ranges. This means we don’t have to squeeze the whole range of possible FP32 numbers into, say, the numbers represented by INT8. To see this, let’s pick out one of the attention weight matrices from our distilled model and plot the frequency distribution of the"

    "## Dynamic quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "### When using dynamic quantization nothing is changed during training and the adaptations are only performed during inference. Like with all the quantization methods we will discuss, the weights of the model are converted to INT8 ahead of inference time. In addition to the weights, the model’s activations are also quantized. This approach is dynamic because the quantization happens on the fly. This means that all the matrix multiplications can be calculated with highly optimized INT8 functions. Of all the quantization methods discussed here, dynamic quantization is the simplest one. However, with dynamic quantization the activations are written and read to memory in floating-point format. This conversion between integer and floating point can be a performance bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instead of computing the quantization of the activations on the fly, we can avoid the conversion to floating point by precomputing the quantization scheme. Static quantization achieves this by observing the activation patterns on a representative sample of the data ahead of inference time. The ideal quantization scheme is calculated and then saved. This enables us to skip the conversion between INT8 and FP32 values and speeds up the computations. However, it requires access to a good data sample and introduces an additional step in the pipeline, since we now need to train and determine the quantization scheme before we can perform inference. There is also one aspect that static quantization does not address: the discrepancy between the precision during training and inference, which leads to a performance drop in the model’s metrics (e.g., accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantization-aware training\n",
    "\n",
    "### The effect of quantization can be effectively simulated during training by “fake” quantization of the FP32 values. Instead of using INT8 values during training, the FP32 values are rounded to mimic the effect of quantization. This is done during both the forward and the backward pass and improves performance in terms of model metrics over static and dynamic quantization."

    "## Making Models Sparser with Weight Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "### So far we’ve seen that knowledge distillation and weight quantization are quite effective at producing faster models for inference, but in some cases you might also have strong constraints on the memory footprint of your model. For example, if our product manager suddenly decides that our text assistant needs to be deployed on a mobile device, then we’ll need our intent classifier to take up as little storage space as possible. To round out our survey of compression methods, let’s take a look at how we can shrink the number of parameters in our model by identifying and removing the least important weights in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  The main idea behind pruning is to gradually remove weight connections (and potentially neurons) during training such that the model becomes progressively sparser. The resulting pruned model has a smaller number of nonzero parameters, which can then be stored in a compact sparse matrix format. Pruning can be also combined with quantization to obtain further compression.\n",
