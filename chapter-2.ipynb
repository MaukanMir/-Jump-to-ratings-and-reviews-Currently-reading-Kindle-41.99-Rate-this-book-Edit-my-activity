    "###  In this chapter, weâ€™ll tackle this task using a variant of BERT called DistilBERT.1 The main advantage of this model is that it achieves comparable performance to BERT, while being significantly smaller and more efficient. This enables us to train a classifier in a few minutes, and if you want to train a larger BERT model you can simply change the checkpoint of the pretrained model. A checkpoint corresponds to the set of weights that are loaded into a given transformer architecture."
